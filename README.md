# Hack-Rf-Projects-Simulations-GnuRadio

There is a hardware folder which contains working gnuradio files for frequency diversity switch and stay combing,frequency diversity Selection combinig ,miso, siso   that can be directly implemented in hackrf tx and rx 

There are also files, apart from hardware, like frequency diversity switch and stay combing,frequency diversity Selection combinig miso, and siso, that can be used in gnuradio directly for simulations
